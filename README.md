# fricas_drawfe :construction: :rocket:
More frontends for FriCAS plotting routines (``draw``).

In order to provide other frontends than the built-in (X11 based) 
comparatively few changes to ``view2D.spad`` and ``view3D.spad`` are
necessary. To avoid confusion the files were (temporarily) renamed to 
``view2D+.spad`` and ``view3D+.spad`` respectively. 


> Initial changes to ``view2D.spad`` and ``view3D.spad``
